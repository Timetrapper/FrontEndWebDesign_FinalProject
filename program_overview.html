            <h1>The SSD Program</h1>
            <p>The Software Systems Developer (SSD) program (Web Programmer option) is an eight month, full-time business application
                development program offered by BCIT's School of Computing and Academic Studies, within the HTP department
                at the downtown Vancouver campus.</p>
            <p>It prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application development, programming,
                database and systems analysis. Students learn industry-ready skills through extensive hands-on practice in
                current scripting and coding techniques, object-oriented architecture patterns, application security and
                scalability, developer tools, and platforms for building complete web-based business applications from scratch.</p>
            <p>Graduates of this certificate program may apply for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor of Technology in Computer
                Systems (additional prerequisites are required).</p>
            <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects.</p>
            <p>While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid understanding
                of object oriented programming as well as possess sound logical and reasoning skills. Applicants with no
                knowledge are advised to take a programming language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming,
                C#, or Java.</p>
