                            systems analysis and design models, including UML, are examined using case studies. Professional
                            looking, device responsive and valid client-side web scripting is introduced with current and
                            cross-browser compliant HTML. A comprehensive study in object-oriented programming fundamentals
                            is delivered through exercises and projects using C#. Lab exercises and projects combine technical
                            skills while also emphasising communication and presentation skills needed in a developer team

                            the end of this course, students are expected to be able to design and build intuitive, device
                            responsive, safe, secure, scalable, and robust commercial applications. As well, this course
                            emphasizes tool and platform selection for effective team development. Techniques for testing
                            and scaling applications are examined. Development patterns using web forms and the model view
                            controller frameworks are practiced. Course work also emphasizes interview and presentation skills
                            for effective project stakeholder communication.

                            major team projects. Both projects challenge participants to research and assemble new technologies.
                            The first project is an internal project to design and build a data-driven commercial web site.
                            The second project involves a four-week term with an industry client to build a web site or web
                            site component. Both projects require agile systems analysis and design, project planning and
                            management, communication of design and progress, professional presentation, and data driven
                            website development using current best practices.
